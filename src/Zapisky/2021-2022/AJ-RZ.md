### Writing a complaint

**Problems with Sencor Imperial headphones**

Dear Mr. Johnson,
I have found your contact information in the Contacts section on the Sencor website. The reason I'm writing directly to you is because the other places I've reached out to so far were not helpful at all. 

Two years ago, I bought the Sencor Imperial HP 900E headphones from a local reseller (Datart) and I've been very happy with them since. However, two months ago, the right channel on the headphones started getting quieter and quieter, to the point where it stopped making any sound at all. I have contacted my local reseller about this, but I've been told that the extended warranty doesn't cover this. I then reached out to the local Sencor authorized repair shop, but again, I haven't been succesful. 

The local Sencor repair shop told me that they can't repair issues like this, not even for money (which I shouldn't pay since it should be covered in the warranty) and offered me a discount on new headphones instead. But what I want is either my current headphones repaired or a brand new product of the same model. The shop refused both of these options. 

I'm not losing my hope yet. I don't mind shipping you the broken unit or waiting for a replacement. I'd really appreciate getting a working unit again, since it seems like it's not possible to buy this model anymore. If there's anything you can do, please let me know, I'd be very grateful.

Best regards

Marek Němec
